# Video Conferencing Web App

A real-time video conferencing web app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with WebRTC integration. This app allows users to connect through seamless video calls, offering high-quality communication for both personal and professional meetings.

## About Video Conferencing with WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing between web browsers without the need for additional plugins or software. WebRTC provides several advantages for building video conferencing applications:

### Advantages of WebRTC for Video Conferencing

- *Low Latency*: WebRTC offers minimal delay, ensuring real-time communication between participants, crucial for smooth video calls.
  
- *Peer-to-Peer Communication*: By directly connecting participants' devices without routing through a server (except for signaling), WebRTC reduces the load on servers and increases call quality.
  
- *No Plugins or Installations*: Since WebRTC is a native browser feature, users do not need to install additional software or plugins, making it easy to use directly from a browser.
  
- *Cross-Platform Support*: WebRTC works across different browsers and devices, allowing participants to join meetings from desktops, laptops, and mobile devices seamlessly.
  
- *Secure Communication*: WebRTC includes built-in encryption for both audio and video streams, ensuring secure and private communication.
  
- *Scalable*: WebRTC supports group video calls, enabling multiple participants to join a conference with high-quality video and audio.

## Tech Stack

- *MongoDB*: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- *Express.js*: Backend framework for building APIs.
- *React*: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- *Node.js*: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- *WebRTC*: Peer-to-peer communication for video, audio, and data transfer.
- *Socket.io*: Real-time event-driven communication for signaling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
